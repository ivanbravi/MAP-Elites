# MAP-Elites
Kotlin implementation of the algorithm created by Jean-Baptiste Mouret and Jeff Clune

The library implements a test case, specifically N-max, with a grid-based visualisation using the [RainbowConsole](https://github.com/ivanbravi/RainbowConsole) kotlin  library for immediate feedback in the console.
